  mutate(`State Abbreviation` = STATE, Rate = RATE, Deaths = DEATHS) %>%
  select(`State Abbreviation`, Rate, Deaths)

# reading in and wrangling csv for educational attainment

  filter(State != "Puerto Rico", State != "Washington DC") %>%
  mutate(`State Abbreviation` = clrdms$`State Abbreviation`)

# joining the previous two datasets
