# Carbon Emissions and Respiratory Illness:

Is there a statewide connection between carbon dioxide emissions levels and respiratory illness?

# Education and Public Health: A Carbon Emissions Point of View

Climate-induced disruptions are increasing in frequency and intensity, in part due to human activity. It has been shown that public health issues can be linked to such disruptions; The CDC has found that "the health effects of [climate-induced] disruptions include increased respiratory and cardiovascular disease, injuries and premature deaths related to extreme weather events, changes in the prevalence and geographical distribution of food- and water-borne illnesses and other infectious diseases, and threats to mental health."[3] Thus, if we care about public health, it seems to make sense to care about reducing carbon emissions.

Solutions aimed at carbon emission reduction tend to focus on mitigation and adaptation measures, and successful implementation of either strategy requires an informed and educated citizenry. Several studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of education programs developed specifically for climate change mitigation (see [1], [2]). However, since targeted climate change education is less common at present than other forms of higher education, we wanted to explore the potential connection between general educational attainment and carbon emissions. 

At the state level, how does educational attainment affect carbon emissions?

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For example, you can include **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text.  For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You should test out updating your GitHub Pages website:

- clone your group's blog project repo in RStudio
- update "Your Project Title Here" to a new title in the YAML header
- knit `index.Rmd` 
- commit and push BOTH the `index.Rmd` and the `index.html` files
- go to https://stat231-f20.github.io/Blog-Healthy-Heroes/ to see the published test document (this is publicly available!)

## Including code and plots

You can embed code as normal, for example:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
mosaic::favstats(~speed, data = cars)
```

Let's clean up the format of that output:

```{r pretty, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
summary(cars) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Speed", "Distance")
        , row.names = F) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped"
                , full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, underline = T) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "1.5in") 
```

In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.  

You can also embed plots as normal, for example:

```{r figure1, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Speed of car (mph)"
       , y = "Distance taken to stop (ft)"
       , title = "cars data (1920s)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
